# Network Hardening Tools 🛡️

## Project Scenario
[cite_start]In this project, I acted as a security analyst for a social media organization that recently suffered a major data breach compromising customer information. [cite_start]The goal was to perform a security risk assessment and implement strong network hardening practices to prevent future attacks[cite: 39, 41].

## Identified Vulnerabilities
During the network inspection, four major vulnerabilities were discovered:
* [cite_start]**Password Sharing:** Employees were sharing credentials, compromising accountability[cite: 41, 45].
* [cite_start]**Default Credentials:** The database admin password was set to the default factory setting[cite: 45].
* [cite_start]**Unfiltered Traffic:** Firewalls lacked rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic[cite: 43, 45].
* [cite_start]**Lack of MFA:** Multifactor authentication was not being used to secure access[cite: 42].

## Hardening Solutions and Analysis
[cite_start]To address these risks, I developed technical documentation based on industry standards like NIST[cite: 42, 47]. These reports cover both the risk assessment and the technical analysis of network traffic.

### 1. Security Risk Assessment Report
[cite_start]This report focuses on the implementation of NIST password standards, MFA, and firewall configurations[cite: 39, 42].

### 2. Cybersecurity Incident Report
[cite_start]This analysis investigates the DNS failure and the ICMP "port unreachable" errors on port 53[cite: 25, 27, 34].

## Conclusion
[cite_start]Implementing NIST password standards, enforcing MFA with biometric confirmation, and configuring strict firewall rules are essential steps to reduce the attack surface and protect customer data[cite: 42, 43].
