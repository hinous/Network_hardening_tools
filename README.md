# Network Hardening Tools 🛡️

## Project Scenario
In this project, I acted as a security analyst for a social media organization that recently suffered a major data breach. The goal was to perform a security risk assessment and implement strong network hardening practices.

## Identified Vulnerabilities
* **Password Sharing:** Employees shared credentials.
* **Default Credentials:** Database admin password was set to factory default.
* **Unfiltered Traffic:** Firewalls lacked traffic filtering rules.
* **Lack of MFA:** Multifactor authentication was not implemented.

## Hardening Solutions and Analysis
Below are the detailed reports. You can read them directly here:
