# Network Hardening Tools

## Project Scenario
In this project, I acted as a security analyst for a social media organization that recently suffered a major data breach compromising customer information. The goal was to perform a security risk assessment and implement strong network hardening practices to prevent future attacks.

## Identified Vulnerabilities
During the network inspection, four major vulnerabilities were discovered:
* **Password Sharing:** Employees were sharing credentials, compromising accountability.
* **Default Credentials:** The database admin password was set to the default factory setting.
* **Unfiltered Traffic:** Firewalls lacked rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic.
* **Lack of MFA:** Multifactor authentication was not being used to secure access.

## Hardening Solutions and Analysis
To address these risks, I developed the following documentation and technical reports based on industry standards like NIST.

### Project Files
* [Hardening Tools ](./Hardening%20Tools%20Report.pdf): Detailed analysis and recommendations for password security, MFA implementation, and firewall configuration.
* [Cybersecurity Incident Report](./Network%20hardening%20tools.pdf): Technical analysis of incident

## Conclusion
By implementing NIST password standards, enforcing MFA with biometric confirmation, and configuring strict firewall rules, the organization can significantly reduce its attack surface and protect customer data from future breaches.
