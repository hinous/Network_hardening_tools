# Network Hardening Tools

## Project Scenario
[cite_start]In this project, I acted as a security analyst for a social media organization that recently suffered a major data breach compromising customer information[cite: 1, 21]. [cite_start]The goal was to perform a security risk assessment and implement strong network hardening practices to prevent future attacks[cite: 2, 22].

## Identified Vulnerabilities
During the network inspection, four major vulnerabilities were discovered:
* [cite_start]**Password Sharing:** Employees were sharing credentials, compromising accountability[cite: 2, 23].
* [cite_start]**Default Credentials:** The database admin password was set to the default factory setting[cite: 18].
* [cite_start]**Unfiltered Traffic:** Firewalls lacked rules to filter incoming and outgoing network traffic[cite: 2, 25].
* [cite_start]**Lack of MFA:** Multifactor authentication was not being used to secure access[cite: 2, 24].

## Hardening Solutions and Analysis
[cite_start]To address these risks, I developed the following documentation and technical reports based on industry standards like NIST[cite: 2, 24].

### Project Files
* [cite_start][Security Risk Assessment Report](./Hardening%20Tools%20Report.pdf): Detailed analysis and recommendations for password security, MFA implementation, and firewall configuration[cite: 21, 26].
* [cite_start][Cybersecurity Incident Report](./Cybersecurity%20incident%20report%20network%20traffic%20analysis%20(1).pdf): Technical analysis of network traffic logs, specifically investigating ICMP "port unreachable" errors on port 53 (DNS)[cite: 4, 6].

## Conclusion
[cite_start]By implementing NIST password standards, enforcing MFA with biometric confirmation, and configuring strict firewall rules, the organization can significantly reduce its attack surface and protect customer data from future breaches[cite: 2, 3].
