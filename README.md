# Network Hardening Tools 🛡️

## Project Scenario
In this project, I acted as a security analyst for a social media organization that recently suffered a major data breach. The goal was to perform a security risk assessment and implement strong network hardening practices based on the following identified vulnerabilities:

* **Password Sharing:** Employees shared credentials.
* **Default Credentials:** Database admin password was set to factory default.
* **Unfiltered Traffic:** Firewalls lacked traffic filtering rules.
* **Lack of MFA:** Multifactor authentication was not implemented.

## Hardening Solutions and Analysis
Below are the official reports developed for this exercise. You can view them directly in your browser:

### 1. Security Risk Assessment Report
This document covers the hardening tools selected (NIST, MFA, Firewall rules) and the justification for their implementation.

## Conclusion
The implementation of these hardening methods significantly reduces the organization's attack surface and protects customer data from future breaches.
